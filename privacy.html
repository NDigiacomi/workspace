     <h2>Introduction and contents</h2>
     <p>
        This is the privacy policy for Youthzilla, our sites such as theguardian.com (“our sites”), and our associated apps. Some of our other sites and services have their own policies, which will be relevant to you when you are using those sites and services.
        
        Our values guide everything that we do – including our editorial approach and how we use personal data. We are strongly committed to keeping your personal data safe. This commitment exists throughout the lifecycle of your personal data, from the design of any Guardian service which uses personal data to the deletion of that data.
        
        To compliment our global approach to privacy protection, this policy also incorporates specific information privacy rights granted to individuals under Californian and Australian privacy law. This reflects our relationship with our readers in these locations where we provide localised editions of our editorial content.
        
        We think carefully about our use of personal data, and below you can find the details of what we do to protect your privacy. This policy covers, among other topics:
        
        Information about your rights, the choices available to you, and our obligations in the European Union, in California, in Australia, and elsewhere
        Transparency about how we collect and use your personal data, including when and how it is shared
        Information on how we protect your personal data
        Information on how we will facilitate your rights and respond to your questions.</p>
