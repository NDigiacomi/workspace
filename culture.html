                <p>You enter #OlafurEliasson into Instagram and scroll through the 170,416 posts that appear then you have pretty much seen the Olafur Eliasson exhibition at Tate Modern. Enter #AnthonyGormley, who also has a blockbuster exhibition on in London at the moment, and a measly 33,773 posts (at the time of writing) will appear. The Tate really hit that social media marketing sweet spot with a retrospective of Eliasson.<br><br>
                Of course, you should actually go to the exhibition. Look up the Danish-Icelandic artist and you will instantly be enamoured by his sincerity. He is an artist doing the impossible: mixing hope, creativity and climate change. What is not to love.
                <br><br>
                Eliasson is an artist with an empowering message. In a recent episode for ‘Abstract: The Art of Design’ on Netflix he said art is about collaboration: “you are a co-author with me. The main protagonist. What you see is quite up to you.” Eliasson does not baby the viewer by imposing one interpretation onto an artwork and writing it in the exhibition notes next to the piece. He is trusting us to engage with our senses, make of it what we will. Buoyed up by this message I approached the exhibition with eagerness.</p>
